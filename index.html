                <br>
                Developed a language learning app using the Electron (Node.Js) platform which allows users to learn multiple languages.
                Created an animated task specific progress bar App as per UX design requirements.
                Implemented a feature that allows Tutors to add and delete tasks as per class requirements, showing the time limit of each task.
                Built the app in such a way that new classes can be created and added to the dropdown list, while old classes can be edited or deleted.
                Designed a feature that contains each task and time in a specific class in its own node/bubble which gets added/deleted/edited from the progress bar upon Tutor request.
                Utilized a fully integrated local storage API to store and access all information.
